# Al<sub>0.3</sub>CoCrFeNi: Atomistics: Dislocation/void interactions

## Foreword

The purpose of this project is to simulate dislocation/void interactions using atomistic simulations in random Al<sub>0.3</sub>CoCrFeNi multi-principal element alloy (MPEA). To provide references, the dislocation/void interactions are also done in Ni.

Please read [these journal articles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pfg0ZztTd7QkhRMLABwpwrZFWDxasoBQ?usp=sharing) to understand dislocatino/void interactions and the effects of voids on mechanical properties in MPEAs and pure metals using atomistic simulations.

## LAMMPS

Following [a related project](https://github.com/shuozhixu/HEAM_2025), we can build LAMMPS with the MANYBODY package and submit jobs on [OSCER](http://www.ou.edu/oscer.html).

We will use the [Farkas-Caro potential](https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2020.294) for all simulations.

## Dislocation/void interactions

Calculate the interactions between a void and an edge or a screw dislocation at 5 K. The atomsk scripts that are used to build the atomistic structures can be found in this GitHub repository. The same LAMMPS input files from [a related project](https://github.com/shuozhixu/MaterLett_2025) are used.
